Terms of Use
============

Copy link

Welcome to Instagram!  
  
These Terms of Use (or “Terms”) govern your access and use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the “Service”), outlined below. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products), provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Instagram.  
  

**1\. The Instagram Service**
-----------------------------

We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:

*   **Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share.** People are different. So we offer you different [types of accounts](https://help.instagram.com/138925576505882?ref=tou&helpref=faq_content) and features to help you create, share, grow your presence, and communicate with people on and off Instagram. We also want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Privacy Policy](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service. Learn more in the [Privacy Policy](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/).
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the [Privacy Policy](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/)) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products depending on your choices.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, or their affiliates. For more information about how we transfer, store or process your information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy).
*   **Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.

  

**2\. How Our Service Is Funded**
---------------------------------

Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-company-products). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.

We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039?helpref=faq_content).

You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/116947042301556?helpref=faq_content).

  

**3\. The Privacy Policy**
--------------------------

Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Privacy Policy](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/) explains how we collect, use, and share information across the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products). It also explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the [Instagram Privacy and Security Settings](https://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?ref=igtos). You must agree to the Privacy Policy to use Instagram.

  

**4\. Your Commitments**
------------------------

In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.

**4.1 Who Can Use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

**4.2 How You Can't Use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.

*   **You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**  
    You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
*   **You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorized purpose.**
*   **You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the [Community Standards](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/), [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/terms), and [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines)**.  
    If you post branded content, you must comply with our [Branded Content Policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/brandedcontent/), which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our [Help Center](https://help.instagram.com/).
*   **You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service.**  
    This includes misusing any reporting, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
*   **You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorized ways.**  
    This includes creating accounts or accessing or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged-in to an Instagram account.
*   **You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service, regardless of whether such data was obtained while logged-in to an Instagram account.**  
    This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
*   **You can't post someone else’s private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit, or pirated goods).**  
    You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, [here](http://help.instagram.com/535503073130320?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content).
*   **You can’t modify, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse engineer our products or their components.**
*   **You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.**
*   **You can't do, or attempt to do, anything to circumvent, by-pass, or override any technological measures that control or limit access to the Service or data.**

**4.3 Permissions You Give to Us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.

*   **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.**  
    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Privacy Policy](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/) and visit the [Instagram Help Center](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Meta Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](https://help.instagram.com/615366948510230?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**

  

**5\. Additional Rights We Retain**
-----------------------------------

*   If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
*   If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
*   You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our [Brand Guidelines](https://about.meta.com/brand/resources/instagram/instagram-brand/) or with our prior written permission.
*   You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.

  

**6\. Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*   We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Community Standards](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/)), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat misinformation. When content has been rated by fact-checkers, we may add a notice to provide additional context. You can find more information about fact-checking [here](https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/features/how-fact-checking-works/). We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Community Standards](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Center](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our [Privacy Policy](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/). After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
        
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
    
*   If you delete or we disable your account, and you stop accessing or using Instagram, or if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section, the section above called “Your Commitments,” and the section below called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled, or deleted, or this contract is otherwise terminated.

  

**7\. Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree**
-----------------------------------------------------

**7.1 Our Agreement.**

*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines), and your use of our API is subject to our [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/terms). If you use certain other features or related services, additional terms will be made available and will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms). If you use Avatars, then the [Avatar Terms](https://help.instagram.com/1823196621218584?helpref=faq_content) also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the [Meta AI Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms) also apply. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

**7.2 Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.**

*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.

  
**7.3 Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.**

*   Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
*   We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.
*   Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible ("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information, or account.

**7.4 How We Will Handle Disputes.**

If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, Meta Platforms Inc. may also bring any claim we have against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere, or engage with our products in unauthorized ways in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.

**7.5 Unsolicited Material.**

We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

  

**8\. Updating These Terms**
----------------------------

We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to access or use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not agree to any updated Terms or wish to terminate your agreement to this contract, you can do so by deleting your account [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos) and no longer accessing or using any part of the Instagram Service.

*   **Prompts, Results, and Other Content**
    
    *   Rights to Content
        
        AIs allows you to provide materials for processing, which could include text, documents, images, or recordings, depending on the integration (together, “Prompts”) and will generate a response (“Outputs”) based on your Prompts, as well as any feedback you provide (“Feedback”) collectively, “Content”. You may not provide Prompts or use AIs in any way that infringes or violates someone else’s rights, including but not limited to privacy and intellectual property rights. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, you retain all right, title, and interest – including any intellectual property rights – that you have in and to your Prompts. You agree that your provision of Prompts will not violate these Terms, including the Acceptable Uses, and other policies that apply to your use of AIs, which we may supplement, update, or revise, at any time.
        
    *   Media Processing
        
        Depending on where you are located, you may have the option to engage with AIs by providing media (e.g., images, audio, video, etc.). For example, you may speak to Meta AI, provide media for editing, or ask questions about media. To work, each time you provide media, the AI technology transforms and represents the media into an embedding to understand the media and provide the requested service.
        
        By providing media to AIs for processing, you represent, warrant and agree that you have, and otherwise provide to Meta, any appropriate permission(s) or consents from persons depicted in such media to conduct such processing.
        
    *   Personal Information
        
        The [Meta Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) explains how we process personal information in the context of AIs, including how we use your interactions with AIs to personalize your experiences and ads, and improve AI at Meta. When you or others interact with AIs, those interactions include information you or others exchange with AIs like Content or messages, along with information we use to make responses from AIs more relevant (like your interests, location and profile).
        
        When information is shared with AIs, the AIs will sometimes retain and use that information. Do not share information that you don’t want the AIs to use and retain, such as information about sensitive topics.
        
        Meta may share certain information with select partners, like search engines, to provide you with the most relevant information in connection with our AIs. [Learn more about how we share information with these partners.](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/dialog/ai-partners) By using AIs, you instruct us to share information for this purpose.
        
        In some cases, Meta will review your interactions with AIs, including the content of your conversations with or messages to AIs, and this review may be automated or manual (human). When you share your private messages with friends and family with AIs that use Private Processing technology, Meta cannot read or access the messages you have shared. Meta provides Private Processing as a service on your behalf.
        
        Depending on where you reside, you or an authorized agent may have the right to request access to your personal information from Meta in a portable format, deletion of your personal information, or correction of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions. To learn more about how you can access and delete your personal information we process in the context of AIs, and exercise any applicable rights, visit our [Privacy Center](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/guide/genai?entry_point=whatsapp_genai). It is important that you review the Privacy Center before you try to delete any personal information or delete or deactivate your account. Depending on how you use AIs, deleting individual messages, entire threads, or even your account may not delete our copy of your personal information, and the Privacy Center describes the correct way to delete your personal information.
        
          
        
    *   Accuracy and Warning Regarding Content
        
        **TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,** META MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OF ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING OUTPUTS, OR ANY OUTPUTS THAT ARE DISTURBING OR UPSETTING. YOU SHOULD NOT RELY UPON OUTPUTS FOR ANY PURPOSE OR USE OUTPUTS TO INFORM PROFESSIONAL ADVICE OR DECISIONS RELATED TO MEDICINE, FINANCE, LAW, OR PHARMACEUTICALS. IF YOU PLAN TO USE OUTPUTS FOR ANY REASON, IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO VERIFY OUTPUTS. AIS AND ANY CONTENT MAY NOT REFLECT ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR CURRENT INFORMATION.
        
        The AIs will generate Content based on Prompts that you provide. The specific Content that the AIs will return based on your Prompts cannot be predicted in advance. AIs MIGHT GENERATE CONTENT THAT YOU CONSIDER OFFENSIVE OR OBJECTIONABLE AND/OR THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT META’S VIEWS. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND BY USING AIS, YOU RECOGNIZE AND ASSUME THE RISK THAT THE PROMPTS YOU PROVIDE MIGHT RESULT IN GENERATION OF CONTENT THAT YOU CONSIDER OFFENSIVE OR OBJECTIONABLE. YOU ALSO RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT YOU – NOT META – ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR USE OF, RESPONSE TO, AND/OR ANY ACTIONS YOU TAKE IN RELATION TO, CONTENT GENERATED BY THE AIS BASED ON YOUR PROMPTS.

        Meta uses Content and related information as described in the Meta Terms of Service and Meta Privacy Policy, and may do so through automated or manual (i.e. human) review and through third-party vendors in some instances, including:
        
        *   To provide, maintain, and improve Meta services and features.
        *   To conduct and support research
        *   To monitor your use of AIs for compliance with these Terms and applicable laws and to report violations of applicable laws or regulations as required by law
        *   To remove unsafe, discriminatory, or other Content that violates these Terms, Meta’s Community Standards, or any other applicable policies and terms
        *   To suspend or remove accounts that violate these Terms with respect to your use of AIs
        
    *   Suspension and Termination
        
        If we determine that you have breached these Terms or other applicable terms and policies, we may suspend or permanently disable your access to AIs or other Meta services or features, and we may permanently disable or delete your account including where we are required to do so for legal reasons.
        
    
*   **Ownership of AIs**
    
    We retain all our respective rights, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to AIs. Other than the rights of access and use expressly granted in these Terms, these Terms do not grant you any right, title, or interest in or to the AIs.
    
*   **Third Party Materials**
    
    AIs may use or be used in connection with content, services, features, and integrations provided by third parties. Meta is not responsible for your use of third party content, services, features, and integrations, and you use these at your own risk.
    
*   **Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitations on Liability**
    
    *   Disclaimer of Warranties
        
        AIs and Outputs are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, and**,** to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we make no guarantees that they will be safe, secure, or error-free, or will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for Outputs, and you are responsible for checking Outputs for accuracy and suitability. The Outputs provided by AIs do not reflect the views of Meta, our affiliates, or our personnel.
        
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY, PRIVACY, COMPATIBILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY IMPLIED BY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR TRADE USAGE.
        
    *   Limitations on Liability
        
        Our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or AIs (however caused and on any theory of liability, including negligence), even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        The laws of some states or jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some or all of the exclusions and limitations set out above may not apply to you. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, in such cases, Meta’s liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
        
    
*   **Disputes**
    
    Any claim, cause of action, or dispute that arises out of or relates to these Terms is subject to the disputes resolution clause in the Meta Terms of Service.
    
*   **Severability**
    
    If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and if it can’t be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
    
*   **Changes to These Terms**
    
    We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience, and/or to comply with applicable law. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example through email or in-app notification) of any material changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect you will be bound by them if you continue to use our **AIs**. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you should stop using AIs before they go into effect.
