About Intellectual Property
---------------------------

Instagram and Threads are committed to helping people and organizations protect their intellectual property rights. The [Instagram Terms of Use](https://help.instagram.com/478745558852511/) do not allow posting content that violates someone else’s intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademark.

Copyright
---------

Copyright is a legal right that seeks to protect original works of authorship (example: books, music, film, art).

Generally, copyright protects original expression such as words or images. It does not protect facts and ideas, although it may protect the original words or images used to describe an idea. Copyright also doesn’t protect things like names, titles and slogans; however, another legal right called a trademark might protect those.

Trademark
---------

A trademark is a word, slogan, symbol or design (example: brand name, logo) that distinguishes the products or services offered by one person, group or company from another. Generally, trademark law seeks to prevent confusion among consumers about who provides or is affiliated with a product or service.

What is copyright and what does it protect?
===========================================

In most countries, copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship. Typically, if you create an original work, you have a copyright from the moment you create it.

Copyright covers a wide variety of types of works, including:

*   Visual or audiovisual works: videos, movies, TV shows and broadcasts, video games, paintings, photographs
*   Audio works: songs, musical compositions, sound recordings, spoken word recordings
*   Written works: books, plays, manuscripts, articles, musical scores

Please note, only an original work is eligible for copyright protection. To be original enough for copyright protection, a work needs to be created by the author themselves and have some minimal amount of creativity.

Generally, names, titles, slogans or short phrases aren't considered to be original enough to qualify for copyright protection. For example, the symbol “+” is likely not subject to copyright, but a painting full of shapes and colors arranged in a unique pattern is likely protected by copyright.

Copyright generally doesn’t protect facts or ideas, but it may protect the original words or images that express a fact or idea. This means that you may be able to express the same idea or fact as another author, as long as you don’t copy that author’s way of expressing that idea or fact. For example, a playwright may not be able to copyright the idea of a man waking up to repeat the same day over and over again, but the script for a play or movie expressing that idea could be subject to copyright.

Learn more about our intellectual property rights in the [Transparency Center](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/intellectual-property/).

- - -

How do I know if I own the copyright in a work?
===============================================

In general, the person who creates an original work owns the copyright. For example, if you create a painting, you likely own the copyright for that painting. Similarly, if you take a photo, you likely own the copyright for that photo.

There may be situations where you might think you have a copyright in a creative work, but you may not. For example:

*   If you appear in a photo or video, that doesn’t necessarily mean you have a copyright in that photo or video. (Learn more about [what to do](https://help.instagram.com/667810236572057?helpref=faq_content) if you think a photo or video on Instagram or Threads might violate your privacy.)
*   If you take a photograph of a sculpture, that doesn’t mean you have the right to prevent someone else from also taking a photograph of the same sculpture.
*   If you create a work as part of your regular job responsibilities, you might not be the owner of the copyright in that work. Instead, there are circumstances where the law will consider your employer to be the “author” of that work for copyright purposes.

If you’re not sure about the extent of your copyright in an original work, you may want to contact an attorney to advise you on your rights.

- - -

What rights do I have as a copyright owner?
===========================================

As a copyright owner, you have certain rights under the law. These include the right to stop others from copying or distributing your work, or from creating new works based on your work. Copyright infringement generally occurs when a person engages in one of these activities without the copyright owner’s permission.

For example, when someone uploads your photo or video, they make a copy of that photo or video. The same is true if someone uses a song in the soundtrack to a video, even if they paid for a copy of that song on another service.

If you own a copyright, you have the right to grant permission to use your copyrighted work, as well as the right to prevent other people from using your copyrighted work without permission.

- - -

How long does copyright protection last?
========================================

Copyright protection doesn’t last forever. Eventually, a work loses copyright protection and becomes part of the “public domain.” Once a work is in the public domain, it’s freely available for anyone to use.

A central purpose of copyright law is to encourage people to make creative works. For this reason, the public domain ensures copyright owners obtain certain rights only for a limited amount of time. This balance between copyright law and the public domain gives the author an incentive to create, but also gives other people the ability to use the work without permission after the copyright expires.

There are many factors that determine when a work becomes part of the public domain. Some of these factors include when and where the work was first published, the type of work and the publisher. For example, the Berne Convention, an international treaty about copyright, states that the copyright for most types of works must last at least 50 years after the author’s death. Countries, however, are free to set longer copyright terms within their own laws.

The difference between copyright and trademark
==============================================

The law in most countries recognizes copyrights as well as trademarks. Copyright law and trademark law serve two different purposes.

[Copyright is](https://help.instagram.com/745146219025379?helpref=faq_content) meant to foster creativity and to provide incentives to create original works of authorship for the benefit of the public. Copyright protects original works like photos, videos, movies and music. It’s also important to note that, in the U.S., the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) applies only to copyrights and doesn’t apply to trademarks.

[Trademark law is](https://help.instagram.com/693466877515116?helpref=faq_content) meant to prevent consumer harm because it prohibits someone other than the rights owner from using a trademark (for example, a brand’s logo) in a way that may confuse consumers. Trademark law protects brand names, slogans, logos or other symbols that help consumers identify the source of goods or services.

How to make sure content you post to Instagram or Threads doesn't violate copyright law
=======================================================================================

Under Instagram’s [Terms of Use](https://help.instagram.com/478745558852511) and Meta's [Community Standards](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards) you can only post content to Instagram or Threads that doesn’t violate someone else's intellectual property rights. The best way to help make sure that what you post to Instagram or Threads doesn’t violate copyright law is to only post content that you’ve created yourself.

Posting content that facilitates copyright infringement through unauthorized devices or services is also not allowed on Instagram or Threads.

It's possible to infringe someone else's copyright when you post their content on Instagram or Threads, or facilitate copyright infringement, even if you:

*   Bought or downloaded the content (example: a song from iTunes)
*   Recorded the content onto your own recording device (examples: a song playing in the background during a party, concert, sporting event, wedding, etc.)
*   Gave credit to the copyright owner
*   Included a disclaimer that you didn’t intend to infringe copyright
*   Didn’t intend to profit from it
*   Modified the work or added your own original material to it
*   Found the content available on the internet
*   Saw that others posted the same content as well
*   Think that the use is a [fair use](https://help.instagram.com/116455299019699?helpref=search&sr=1&query=fair+use&search_session_id=8aa28133c81800559a4366cb5bb4c6a3)
*   Are using an unauthorized streaming device or service (examples: a “jailbroken” or “loaded” app or service)

Before you post content on Instagram or Threads, you may want to ask:

*   Did I create all of the content myself?
*   Do I have permission to use all of the content included in my post?
*   Does my use of the content fall within [an exception to copyright infringement](https://help.instagram.com/116455299019699?helpref=faq_content)?
*   Is the content protected by copyright (for example, is it a short phrase, a concept or idea, or a work that has fallen into the public domain)?

It’s generally a good idea to get written permission from the author of the work before posting content on Instagram or Threads. You might be able to use someone else’s content on Instagram or Threads if you’ve gotten permission from them, such as through obtaining a license. You also may be able to use someone else's content if it's in the public domain, is covered by fair use, or there is another exception to copyright.

What are fair use and other exceptions to copyright?
====================================================

Laws across the globe recognize that strict application of copyright laws in certain cases may be unfair or may inappropriately stifle creativity or stop people from creating original works, which would harm the public. These laws allow people to use, under certain circumstances, someone else's copyrighted work. Common examples include use for the purpose of criticism, commentary, parody, satire, news reporting, teaching, education and research.

The United States and some other countries follow the “fair use” doctrine, while other countries, including those in the European Union, provide other exceptions or limitations to copyright. These exceptions or limitations permit users to use copyrighted material where appropriate. You may want to seek legal advice if you have questions about the possibility to use someone else’s copyrighted work within the limits set by the law.

Fair use
--------

Though it's often difficult to know if a particular use of copyrighted work is a fair use, the law offers some factors you can consider:

1.  **The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes:**

Does the use transform or change the original work by adding new meaning, context or expression? Using a fashion photograph to discuss the amount of photo editing used in the photograph is more likely to be fair use than simply posting the photograph without comment. Parodies may be fair use if they imitate a work in a way that criticizes or comments on the original work.

Is the use commercial or purely personal? Commercial, or for-profit, uses are less likely to be considered fair use.

4.  **The nature of the copyrighted work:**

The use of factual works like maps or databases is more likely to be fair use than the use of highly creative works like poems or science-fiction movies.

6.  **The amount and substance of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole:**

The use of small portions of a copyrighted work is more likely to be fair use than copying an entire work. But even if only a small portion is used, it is less likely to be fair if that portion used is the most important piece — the “heart” of the work.

8.  **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work:**

Will the use replace the original work such that people stop buying or viewing the copyrighted work? If so, this is less likely to be fair use.

To learn more about fair use in the U.S., you can visit the [U.S. Copyright Office Fair Use Index](https://copyright.gov/fair-use/).

Exceptions to Copyright
-----------------------

The application of exceptions and limitations to copyright may vary from country to country. As a general matter, in countries that rely on exceptions and limitations, the use of copyrighted works should not unreasonably harm a rights holder’s interests.

In the EU, each Member State must ensure that users are able to rely on the following exceptions when making content available: quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche. To learn more about copyright law in the EU, you can visit the [EUIPO website.](https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/web/observatory/faqs-on-copyright-sk)

Can I still violate another person's copyright on Instagram or Threads if I didn't intend to infringe?
======================================================================================================

It's possible to infringe someone else's copyright, even if you don't intend to do so. In most cases, you shouldn’t use someone else’s copyrighted work if you don’t have permission.

Keep in mind that your use of someone else’s content may infringe their copyright, even if you:

*   Gave credit to the copyright owner
*   Included a disclaimer that you don’t intend to infringe copyright
*   Think that the use is a [fair use](https://www.facebook.com/help/337995452911154?helpref=faq_content)
*   Didn’t intend to profit from it
*   Legally bought or downloaded the content (example: a copy of a DVD or a song from the Internet)
*   Modified the work or added your own original material to it
*   Found the content available on the internet
*   Recorded the content onto your own recording device (example: from a movie, concert or sporting event)
*   Saw that others have posted the same content as well

Repeat Infringer Policy
-----------------------

If you repeatedly post content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights, such as copyrights or trademarks, your account may be disabled or your Page removed under Instagram’s repeat infringer policy.

Under this policy, your ability to post photos or videos may be limited, and you could also lose access to certain features or functionality on Instagram or Threads. The actions taken under the policy may depend on the nature of the reported content and where it was posted.

If something you posted is restored due to an appeal or because a rights owner withdrew their report, we’ll take that restoration into account under our repeat infringer policy.

How Instagram and Threads process United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) counter-notifications
=============================================================================================================

Instagram and Threads comply with the notice-and-takedown procedures set out in section 512(c) of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which applies to content reported and removed for violating U.S. copyrights.

If your content is removed under the DMCA, you'll receive instructions about how to file a counter-notification in the messages we send you. You should only submit a counter-notification if the content was removed because of a mistake or misidentification. Please note that if your content was removed for reasons unrelated to a copyright report, you may not receive a response from us.

When we receive a valid DMCA counter-notification, we forward it to the party that reported the content. The information they receive includes your contact information, which they can use to contact you. If we provide your counter-notification to the party that reported the content, and they don't notify us that they have filed a court action seeking an order to keep the content down, we will restore or cease disabling eligible content under the DMCA. This process can take up to 14 business days. Please note, in rare instances, we may not be able to restore content due to technical limitations. If this happens, we’ll send you an update letting you know you may repost the content at your discretion.

Content that is restored based on an effective DMCA counter-notification will not be counted against you under our repeat infringer policy.

What to consider before submitting an intellectual property infringement report to Instagram or Threads
=======================================================================================================

**Consider your copyright and trademark permissions**
-----------------------------------------------------

Submitting a report of intellectual property infringement is a serious matter with potential legal consequences.

Consider whether the content you want to report may be:

*   [A permissible use of your copyright](https://help.instagram.com/116455299019699?helpref=faq_content)
*   [Your trademark](https://help.instagram.com/752100651636285?helpref=faq_content)

If you’re not sure whether the content you’re reporting infringes your intellectual property rights, because it may be a fair use or otherwise, you may want to seek legal guidance.

Intentionally submitting misleading or otherwise fraudulent reports of copyright or trademark infringement may lead to Meta taking action, including termination of your account.

For copyright, it’s important to note that intentionally submitting a misleading or fraudulent report may also lead to liability for damages under section 512(f) of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or similar laws in other countries.

More about trademarks and what they protect
===========================================

A trademark is a word, slogan, symbol or design (for example, a brand name or logo) that a person or company uses to distinguish their products or services from those offered by others. A trademark is protectable when it’s used in a distinctive way to identify a product or service. Whether you know it or not, you see trademarks all day long, whether in stores shopping, watching commercials on TV and so on.

Generally, trademark law seeks to protect consumers from being confused about who provides, endorses or is affiliated with a particular product or service. To prevent this situation, a trademark owner may be able to stop others from using their trademark (or a similar trademark) without permission if that use may cause confusion.

Not all terms are subject to trademark protection under the law. Protection depends on a variety of factors, including how unique, generic or descriptive the trademark is and the manner that it’s used. For example, the term “Banana” may be protectable as a trademark to identify an electronics company, but perhaps not to describe a banana farm. In addition, many trademark owners obtain registrations for their trademarks under relevant law, but registration may not be necessary for a trademark to be protected.

Please note that Instagram and Threads can’t adjudicate disputes between third parties, and so we wouldn’t be in a position to act on trademark reports that require an in-depth trademark analysis. This is also the case for trademark reports that appear to involve a real-world dispute that wouldn’t be resolved by any action that Instagram or Threads could take. In these situations, rather than contacting Instagram or Threads, you may want to reach out directly to the party that you believe is infringing your rights, or seek any resolution in court or by other judicial means. If you’re sure you want to report content on Instagram or Threads that you believe infringes your trademark, you can do so by [completing this form](https://help.instagram.com/contact/372592039493026).

What is trademark infringement?
===============================

Generally, trademark infringement occurs when:

1.  A person uses a trademark owner’s trademark (or similar trademark) without permission.
2.  That person’s use is in commerce, meaning that it’s done in connection with the sale or promotion of goods or services AND
3.  That use is likely to confuse consumers about the source, endorsement or affiliation of the person’s goods or services.

The touchstone of trademark infringement is often “likelihood of confusion,” and there are many factors that are considered to determine if a use of a trademark is likely to cause confusion. For example, when a person’s trademark is also used by someone else, but on unrelated goods or services, that use may not be infringement because it may not cause confusion. Which party used the trademark first can often be an important consideration as well. There are also many [limits to trademark rights](https://help.instagram.com/752100651636285?helpref=faq_content), such as geographic limitations, as well as the ability for someone to use your trademark to lawfully comment on or criticize your goods or services.

Please note that the law in different countries relating to trademark rights and trademark infringement can vary. If you’re not sure if a particular use of a trademark would be considered infringement, you may want to consult with an attorney.

- - -

Does a trademark need to be registered to be protected?
=======================================================

It depends. In the U.S., a trademark can be registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Federal registrations with the USPTO establish trademark rights as of a certain date and provide a presumption that the registrant owns a valid trademark, among other things. For these reasons, trademark owners often obtain USPTO registrations.

Outside the U.S., many other countries have adopted similar systems, including the ability for trademark owners to register their trademarks. Both in the U.S. and in other countries, depending on the relevant laws, a trademark owner may still have certain rights without a registration. Typically, a trademark owner’s rights without a registration (often known as common law rights) may be weaker than rights that are subject to a registration. Also, it’s important to keep in mind that registering a company with a government office or getting a permit to do business in a specific country or state (for example, a business registration) usually doesn’t itself create a trademark right.

- - -

What is the difference between a trademark registration and a business registration?
====================================================================================

In some countries or states in the U.S., a business might be able to register with a government office, or obtain a permit or license to do business in that country or state. These registrations, such as ones issued by a state’s Secretary of State, generally aren’t the same as a trademark registration, and may not themselves create trademark rights for the business. In the U.S., the registration that’s frequently used to establish trademark ownership is one that is issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).

How long does trademark protection last?
========================================

Trademark rights may last indefinitely, but only if the trademark owner continues to use the trademark in commerce to identify their products or services. If a trademark owner stops using the trademark, or if it isn’t used properly, they might lose their trademark rights. Please also note that for trademarks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), issued registrations must be renewed periodically. The laws in other jurisdictions may vary.

- - -

What is a counterfeit?
======================

A counterfeit good is a knockoff or replica version of another company’s product. It usually copies the trademark (name or logo) and/or distinctive features of that other company’s product to imitate a genuine product. The manufacture, promotion or sale of a counterfeit good is a type of trademark infringement that is illegal in most countries, and is recognized as being harmful to consumers, trademark owners and honest sellers. Please note that counterfeit goods may be unlawful even if the seller explicitly says that the goods are counterfeit, or otherwise disclaims authenticity of the goods.

If you believe content on Instagram or Threads is selling or promoting counterfeit goods, you can report it to us [by filling out this form](https://www.instagram.com/help/ipreporting/report/trademark/) or by using the [Brand Rights Protection tool](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/828925381043253?helpref=faq_content), which enables a rights holder to identify and report violating content for trademark, copyright, and counterfeit.

- - -

Are there any limits to trademark rights?
=========================================

Not all uses of a trademark without permission of the trademark owner are necessarily an infringement of that trademark. The use of a trademark is only infringing if it’s likely to confuse people regarding the source, endorsement or affiliation of products or services. So, if a trademark is used in a way that is unlikely to cause consumer confusion, it’s generally not considered infringing.

Notably, simply referring to a trademark for the purpose of discussing the product or service offered probably won’t be an infringing use of the trademark, as long as that reference doesn’t use more of the trademark than is needed to make its point. In fact, you might need to use the trademark to describe or comment on a particular product or service. This is known as the doctrine of nominative fair use, and typically permits such uses as commentary, criticism, parody, reviews and, in some countries, comparative advertising.

And while these matters are very fact-specific, trademark rights also often don’t prevent:

*   The resale of legitimate goods or selling legitimate goods through channels that are not authorized by the trademark owner.
*   The use of a trademarked word in its ordinary dictionary meaning.
*   The use of a trademark in a way that is not related to the sale or promotion of products or services.

Trademark rights are generally limited to the geographic territory where the trademark owner uses the trademark to identify their goods or services. For example, if a trademark owner uses a trademark to refer to their restaurant in Country A, they likely won’t be able to prevent another person from using the same term to refer to their own restaurant in Country B.

- - -

The difference between copyright and trademark
==============================================

The law in most countries recognizes copyrights as well as trademarks. Copyright law and trademark law serve two different purposes.

[Copyright is](https://help.instagram.com/745146219025379?helpref=faq_content) meant to foster creativity and to provide incentives to create original works of authorship for the benefit of the public. Copyright protects original works like photos, videos, movies and music. It’s also important to note that, in the U.S., the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) applies only to copyrights and doesn’t apply to trademarks.

[Trademark law is](https://help.instagram.com/693466877515116?helpref=faq_content) meant to prevent consumer harm because it prohibits someone other than the rights owner from using a trademark (for example, a brand’s logo) in a way that may confuse consumers. Trademark law protects brand names, slogans, logos or other symbols that help consumers identify the source of goods or services.

How to make sure the content you post to Instagram or Threads don't violate trademark law
=========================================================================================

Under Instagram's [Terms of Use](https://help.instagram.com/478745558852511) and Meta's [Community Standards](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards) you can only post content to Instagram or Threads if it doesn't violate the intellectual property rights of another party, including trademarks. Please note that as an Instagram or Threads user, you are responsible for the content you post. If your content violates Threads or Instagram's policies or is reported to Instagram or Threads as infringing the intellectual property rights of another party, Instagram or Threads may remove that content.

Before you post content, you might want to ask:

*   Have I used someone else's trademark to sell or promote goods or services in a way that may confuse people?
*   Does my use of a trademark only refer to someone else’s goods or services, or make some other type of non-infringing use of the trademark (example: using a trademarked word in its ordinary dictionary meaning, or using the trademark in a way that is not related to the sale or promotion of products or services)?

If you have questions about trademark law or whether your content infringes another party’s trademark rights, you may want to contact an attorney.

What to consider before submitting an intellectual property infringement report to Instagram or Threads
=======================================================================================================

**Consider your copyright and trademark permissions**
-----------------------------------------------------

Submitting a report of intellectual property infringement is a serious matter with potential legal consequences.

Consider whether the content you want to report may be:

*   [A permissible use of your copyright](https://help.instagram.com/116455299019699?helpref=faq_content)
*   [Your trademark](https://help.instagram.com/752100651636285?helpref=faq_content)

If you’re not sure whether the content you’re reporting infringes your intellectual property rights, because it may be a fair use or otherwise, you may want to seek legal guidance.

Intentionally submitting misleading or otherwise fraudulent reports of copyright or trademark infringement may lead to Meta taking action, including termination of your account.

For copyright, it’s important to note that intentionally submitting a misleading or fraudulent report may also lead to liability for damages under section 512(f) of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or similar laws in other countries.

=========================================

Not all uses of a trademark without permission of the trademark owner are necessarily an infringement of that trademark. The use of a trademark is only infringing if it’s likely to confuse people regarding the source, endorsement or affiliation of products or services. So, if a trademark is used in a way that is unlikely to cause consumer confusion, it’s generally not considered infringing.

- - -

What are fair use and other exceptions to copyright?
====================================================

Laws across the globe recognize that strict application of copyright laws in certain cases may be unfair or may inappropriately stifle creativity or stop people from creating original works, which would harm the public. These laws allow people to use, under certain circumstances, someone else's copyrighted work. Common examples include use for the purpose of criticism, commentary, parody, satire, news reporting, teaching, education and research.

The United States and some other countries follow the “fair use” doctrine, while other countries, including those in the European Union, provide other exceptions or limitations to copyright. These exceptions or limitations permit users to use copyrighted material where appropriate. You may want to seek legal advice if you have questions about the possibility to use someone else’s copyrighted work within the limits set by the law.

Fair use
--------

Though it's often difficult to know if a particular use of copyrighted work is a fair use, the law offers some factors you can consider:

1.  **The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes:**

Does the use transform or change the original work by adding new meaning, context or expression? Using a fashion photograph to discuss the amount of photo editing used in the photograph is more likely to be fair use than simply posting the photograph without comment. Parodies may be fair use if they imitate a work in a way that criticizes or comments on the original work.

Is the use commercial or purely personal? Commercial, or for-profit, uses are less likely to be considered fair use.

4.  **The nature of the copyrighted work:**

The use of factual works like maps or databases is more likely to be fair use than the use of highly creative works like poems or science-fiction movies.

6.  **The amount and substance of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole:**

The use of small portions of a copyrighted work is more likely to be fair use than copying an entire work. But even if only a small portion is used, it is less likely to be fair if that portion used is the most important piece — the “heart” of the work.

8.  **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work:**

Will the use replace the original work such that people stop buying or viewing the copyrighted work? If so, this is less likely to be fair use.

To learn more about fair use in the U.S., you can visit the [U.S. Copyright Office Fair Use Index](https://copyright.gov/fair-use/).

Exceptions to Copyright
-----------------------

The application of exceptions and limitations to copyright may vary from country to country. As a general matter, in countries that rely on exceptions and limitations, the use of copyrighted works should not unreasonably harm a rights holder’s interests.

In the EU, each Member State must ensure that users are able to rely on the following exceptions when making content available: quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche. To learn more about copyright law in the EU, you can visit the [EUIPO website.](https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/web/observatory/faqs-on-copyright-sk)

How to appeal the removal of content on Instagram or Threads for copyright reasons
==================================================================================

If your content was removed because of a copyright report, you can submit an appeal or a DMCA counter-notification. You received instructions in the message we sent you.

*   If we have informed you that content you posted was removed under the notice and counter-notice procedures of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), you may be able to file a DMCA counter-notification.

*   If your content was removed because of a copyright report submitted outside the DMCA procedures, you can submit an appeal. Instructions about how to submit an appeal are included in the message we have sent you. If your account has been disabled, you can submit an appeal by logging into your account and following the on-screen instructions.
